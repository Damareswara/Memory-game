## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## I followed below steps in order to develop Memory game.

-   Download Basic outline project from GitHub, which was provided by
    Udacity in rubric structure. <https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game>
-   Download the zip file from the GitHub
-   Extract the zip file into folder
-   Then i came to under stand the program used  JavaScript to add dynamic styles to html page `app.js`
-   `index.html` this is root file of the Project
-   `img` is the folder where the projects images are saved
    \+`app.css` is the style sheet of project

\##errors rectified process

-   I rectified errors by trial and error method
-   Step by step I rectified every errors
    ## idea
-   By seeing skeleton structure of GitHub Udacity project i understand the coding of the project
-   For storing of all cards in an array the variable is `nodeList[]`
-   I used the `timeStart()` function for calculate the time
-   The function `starRating()` is for shoeing the score of the player
-   The condition for scoring is if the moves between 12to18 the score is achieved by player is 2Stars
-   For counting the number of moves I us the function `moveSection()`
-   If all cards are matched in the game the timer will stop and the sweet alert display the moves, time and stars
-   By using above steps successfully completed memory game
